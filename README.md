by Sean Chan (swchan@ucsd.edu) and Junyi Xu (jux006@ucsd.edu)


## Introduction
Question: What are factors of major outages which lead to significant financial loss?
Significance: Outages halt productivity at all levels 
For our project, we were given a dataset of major outages in the United States between January 2000 and July 2016. Each row represents a single documented outage with their columns containing information on data such as but not limited to the year, month, state, and cause of the outage.
There are 1535 rows in the dataset which indicates that the dataset documents 1535 outage events. The columns that we look at in our project are detailed in the table below.
